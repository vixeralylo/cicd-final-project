# cicd-final-project

## Project Name

**cicd-final-project** — a minimal Node.js project created for learning Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) concepts as part of a Coursera course.

## Description

This project intentionally keeps the application logic as simple as possible (a single `console.log("Hello, World!")`) so that the focus stays entirely on building and understanding a CI/CD pipeline rather than on application complexity.

## Project Structure

```

```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+

## How to Run

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

Expected output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## How to Test

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## How to Lint

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
```

## CI/CD

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** (see [`.github/workflows/workflow.yml`](.github/workflows/workflow.yml)) to automatically, inside a `node:18` container:

1. Checkout the code
2. Setup Node.js
3. Install dependencies
4. Linting (ESLint)
5. Run unit tests (Jest)
6. Run the application

The pipeline is triggered on every `push` and `pull_request` to the `main`/`master` branch.
